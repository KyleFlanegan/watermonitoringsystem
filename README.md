IoT Water Tank Monitoring System
A complete solution for remotely monitoring water levels and controlling a borehole pump from any mobile device.

Project Overview
This repository contains documentation and code for building an IoT water monitoring system that allows:
- Remote monitoring of water tank levels
- Remote control of a borehole pump
- Automatic leak detection
- Historical water level tracking

The system consists of three main components:
- A solar-powered water tank monitoring station
- A pump control station
- A web interface accessible from any device
 
Demo
A functional demo of the web interface is included in this repository. Open the water-tank-interface.html file in any browser to interact with the simulated system:
- Toggle the pump switch to see the water level change
- Watch as the system automatically turns off the pump when the tank is full (90%)
- Observe different system status messages based on conditions
- Try different history view options (Day/Week/Month)

System Architecture
The system uses LoRa (Long Range) technology to communicate between the solar-powered water tank station and the pump control station. This provides reliable connectivity without requiring cellular data plans or WiFi at the tank location.

Features
- Real-time Monitoring: View current water levels from anywhere
- Remote Control: Turn the pump on/off from your mobile device
- Automatic Operation: System automatically turns off the pump when the tank is full
- Leak Detection: Alerts for potential leaks in the tank or pipes
- Historical Data: Track water usage patterns over time
- Solar Powered: Self-sufficient monitoring station requires no grid power
- Low Maintenance: Reliable components designed for long-term operation
